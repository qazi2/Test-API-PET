**Maven:**
Maven is a build automation tool that is mostly used in Java projects. Maven can also be used to create and manage projects written in other languages such as C#, Ruby, Scala, and others. For more information: https://maven.apache.org/

**Rest - Assured:**
Rest-Assured is an open-source Java DSL that simplifies REST service testing. It makes things easier by removing the need for boilerplate code when testing and validating complex replies. It can also handle XML and JSON requests and responses. For more information: http://rest-assured.io/

**Cucumber:**
Cucumber examines all of the executable tests and steps written in plain English and verifies what the software is supposed to do. For more information: https://cucumber.io/

**TestNG:**
We have used the TestNG library because it supports a wide range of annotations. It also has excellent Test Case management capabilities and, most crucially, a user-friendly reporting interface. For more information related to TestNG - https://testng.org/doc/
